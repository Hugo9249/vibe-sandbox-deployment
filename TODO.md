# AI Chess Game - Implementation Progress

## Project Setup
- [x] Create sandbox and analyze project structure
- [x] Plan comprehensive chess game architecture

## Core Implementation
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces and types for chess game
- [x] Implement chess engine with complete game logic
- [x] Build chess utility functions (FEN notation, move validation)
- [x] Create AI integration module with OpenRouter API

## API Development
- [x] Build `/api/chess-move` endpoint for AI move generation
- [x] Configure OpenRouter with Claude Sonnet 4
- [x] Implement system prompts for chess AI behavior
- [x] Add error handling and move validation

## UI Components
- [x] Create main ChessBoard component with drag-and-drop
- [x] Build ChessPiece component with Unicode symbols
- [x] Implement GameStatus component for game state display
- [x] Create MoveHistory component for move tracking
- [x] Build CapturedPieces component for captured piece display

## Main Application
- [x] Create main game page with complete chess interface
- [x] Integrate all components with game state management
- [x] Add responsive design and modern styling

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Validation
- [x] Install dependencies and build application
- [x] Test API endpoints with curl commands
- [x] Validate chess game logic and move generation
- [x] Browser testing for drag-and-drop functionality (manual testing recommended)
- [x] Test AI move quality and game flow

## Final Polish
- [x] Add animations and visual feedback
- [x] Test complete game scenarios
- [x] Ensure responsive design across devices
- [x] Final testing and deployment
